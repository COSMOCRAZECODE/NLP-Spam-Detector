## üì© Spam Message Classifier using NLP & Machine Learning

A beginner-friendly NLP project that classifies SMS messages as **spam** or **ham** using **TF-IDF vectorization** and traditional **machine learning models** like Logistic Regression. This was built as a foundational project to learn text preprocessing, feature extraction, and evaluation.


# üìå Part 2: Motivation & Problem Statement
## üí° Motivation

With the rising number of spam messages targeting users daily, building a spam detection system becomes an essential application of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to NLP and Machine Learning through a real-world use case ‚Äî SMS spam classification.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Given a dataset of SMS messages labeled as "ham" (legitimate) or "spam", the goal is to:

- Preprocess and clean the raw text data
- Convert it into numerical features using TF-IDF
- Train a classification model to accurately predict whether a new message is spam or not
- Evaluate the performance using metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy, and precision-recall


# üìÇ Part 3: Dataset & Preprocessing
## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** from Kaggle.

- It contains 5,572 SMS messages in English.
- Each message is labeled as either:
  - `ham` ‚Äî a normal, legitimate message.
  - `spam` ‚Äî an unsolicited promotional or fraudulent message.

## üßπ Data Preprocessing

Before feeding the text into a machine learning model, the following preprocessing steps were performed:

1. **Lowercasing** ‚Äî to reduce vocabulary size.
2. **Removing Punctuation** ‚Äî to clean out symbols like `!`, `?`, `,` etc.
3. **Removing Numbers** ‚Äî as numeric noise often isn't helpful in SMS spam detection.
4. **Removing Extra Spaces** ‚Äî to normalize the format.
5. **TF-IDF Vectorization** ‚Äî to convert text into numerical features based on term frequency.

These transformations help in building a clean and standardized representation of the messages.


# üß† Part 4: Model Building Summary + Evaluation Metrics
## üß† Model Building

For this project, I experimented with three different classification models:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

These models are well-suited for high-dimensional data like text after vectorization using TF-IDF. Comparing multiple models helped determine which performed best for the spam detection task.

### ‚úÖ Why These Models?

- **Logistic Regression**: Simple, fast, and effective for binary classification.
- **Naive Bayes**: Performs well in text classification and handles word probabilities.
- **SVM**: Known for high accuracy and robust decision boundaries, especially on complex datasets.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate performance, I used:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions.
- **Precision**: Ratio of correctly predicted spam messages to total predicted spam.
- **Recall**: Ratio of correctly predicted spam messages to all actual spam messages.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes the distribution of true/false positives/


# üéØ Part 5: Results & Insights
## üéØ Results & Insights

After training and evaluating all three models, here's a summary of their performance:

| Model                   | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression     | 0.96     | 0.95      | 0.94   | 0.945    |
| Multinomial Naive Bayes | 0.98     | 0.97      | 0.98   | 0.975    |
| Support Vector Machine  | 0.97     | 0.96      | 0.95   | 0.955    |

> ‚úÖ **Best Model**: Based on both **accuracy** and **F1 score**, the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model performed the best. It‚Äôs fast, simple, and particularly effective with TF-IDF representations of text data.

### üìå Key Takeaways:

- **Naive Bayes** thrives on word-frequency-based features (like TF-IDF), which made it ideal for this spam detection problem.
- **TF-IDF** helped reduce the impact of common words and highlight more "spammy" terms.
- Even simple models can achieve **high accuracy** if the data is well-preprocessed and the pipeline is clean.
- Comparing models gave deeper insights and built confidence in choosing the best-performing algorithm.

### üß† Lesson Learned:

The biggest learning here was that **model performance isn't everything** ‚Äî how you **preprocess**, **represent text**, and **evaluate with the right metrics** is what really makes or breaks an ML solution.


# üìò Part 6: Challenges Faced & Learnings
## üìò Challenges Faced & Learnings

### üîç Challenges Faced:

- Initially, TF-IDF transformation seemed to output all zeros ‚Äî the issue turned out to be unrelated to the vectorizer and was actually due to label mismatch in the confusion matrix.
- Preprocessing the text (removing punctuation, digits, and extra spaces) was tricky since I wasn't familiar with regex and natural language cleaning.
- Understanding the role of `TfidfVectorizer` and how it actually transforms text into numerical values took some effort and hands-on experimentation.

### üí° Key Learnings:

- I learned the importance of **clean data** ‚Äî especially when working with text. Even small mistakes in labels or formatting can break evaluation metrics.
- Discovered how **TF-IDF** downplays common words and boosts unique, informative words ‚Äî perfect for spam detection.
- Explored multiple classification models and compared them using proper evaluation metrics like **Precision, Recall, F1 Score**, not just Accuracy.
- Got hands-on experience debugging, reading errors carefully, and **iterating quickly** to solve them.
- Learned how crucial it is to **document everything**, structure code well, and break a big project into meaningful phases.

> üìå This project gave me a solid foundation in **real-world NLP pipelines**, **ML model selection**, and how to communicate insights clearly.


# üß† Part 7: Future Work & Improvements üîÆ
## üîÆ Future Work & Improvements

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use Grid Search or Randomized Search to further optimize model performance.
- **Use of Ensemble Models**: Combine models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes or try advanced techniques like XGBoost or LightGBM for better accuracy.
- **Deep Learning Approaches**: Explore LSTM, BERT or other Transformer-based models for improved semantic understanding.
- **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Use techniques like SMOTE or class weights to better handle class imbalance if necessary.
- **Text Cleaning Improvements**: Incorporate stopword removal, lemmatization, or domain-specific filtering to improve text quality.
- **User Interface**: Build a simple web interface using Streamlit or Flask so users can try it live.
- **Model Interpretability**: Add SHAP or LIME to explain predictions and increase model transparency.
- **Data Augmentation**: Create synthetic messages to help the model generalize better.

> üöÄ These improvements could not only increase performance but also transform this project into a real-world, production-grade application.
